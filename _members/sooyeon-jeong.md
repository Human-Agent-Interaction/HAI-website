Sooyeon Jeong is an Assistant Professor in Computer Science at Purdue University and the director of the Human-Agent Interaction Laboratory. Her research focuses on designing and deploying interactive AI agents that can improve people's lives by providing personalized support based on each user's needs, traits, and behaviors. She deploys these agents "in-the-wild" to evaluate how they build relationships and rapport with people over time to improve their wellbeing, health and learning. Sooyeon received a S.B. and a M.Eng. from the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS), and a S.M. and a Ph.D in Media Arts and Sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Prior to joining Purdue, she spent one year as a NIH National Research Service Award (NRSA) Postdoctoral Fellow at the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CBITs) in Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
