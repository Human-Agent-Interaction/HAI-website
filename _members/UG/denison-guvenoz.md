Denison Guvenoz is currently a sophomore majoring in Computer and Information Technology at Purdue University with a minor in Statistics. She has always had a fascination with artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction and the endless possibilities that come with the two, so when she was given the opportunity to work with Dr. Jeong on a project involving just that, she was more than happy to hop on board. Currently, Denison is working alongside Avery Kruppe on annotating and analyzing videos of a social robot interacting with human participants, taking note of when the robot can successfully hold its own in an interaction as well as when it cannot.
