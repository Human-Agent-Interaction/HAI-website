I am a passionate Computer Science graduate with interests in Deep Learning, Computer Vision, and Android development. I have one year of work experience in the fields of sensor intelligence, signal processing, and on-device AI implementation at Samsung Research. Currently, at the Purdue HAI lab, I am conducting research and studies on the implications of Social Robots like Misty on data collection and user privacy with older adults. Ever curious and enthusiastic about learning new technologies!
