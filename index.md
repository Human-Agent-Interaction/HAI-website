Welcome to Human and Agent Interaction (**HAI**) lab at Purdue University. Our research focuses on designing and deploying interactive AI agents that can improve people's lives by providing personalized support based on each user's needs, traits, and behaviors. We deploy these agents in-the-wild to evaluate how they build relationships and rapport with people over time and improve their wellbeing, health, and learning.
