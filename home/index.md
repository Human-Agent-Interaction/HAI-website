We are part of the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/) at [Purdue University](https://www.purdue.edu/) and are located on the ground floor of the Felix Haas Hall (G14).

Students, Visiting Researchers & Scholars (BS/MS/PhDs/Post-docs)
We are always looking for students/scholars at all levels (BS/MS/PhDs/Post-docs) with a strong relevant background in Robotics, Human-Computer Interaction, Affective Computing, and Applied Machine Learning. If you are interested in working with us, please fill out this form. 

# Current Purdue Ph.D./M.S./B.S. Students 
Please reach out to Prof. Sooyeon Jeong(mailto:sooyeonj@purdue.edu) to inquire about open positions in the lab and state how 

Non-Purdue students who are seeking M.S./Ph.D. positions will have to apply online through the [Purdue CS admission portal](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/graduate/index.html) and mention Prof. Sooyeon Jeong as a potential advisor.

Collaborations & Partnerships
Our work aligns closely with the industry for solving a wide range of collaborative, multi-agent, robotics and autonomous driving problems in the natural dynamic world. If you have an idea or are interested in collaboration, please contact us.
