  description: Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITSs) can democratize access to information by providing an engaging learning experience that has been shown to improve learning recall for the medium to long term. While current ITSs span from basic reading comprehension to positive psychology interventions, we noticed a lack of ITSs designed for underserved populations. To bridge this gap, this project aims to develop and test an ITS aimed at cancer survivorship for low literacy Latinas.

  description: The aim is to conduct a detailed study of different privacy issues in the process of data collection from various sensors on a social robot. Specifically, we concentrate on aged people (65+ year-old) and their interactions with social robots, their views on privacy issues, and their thoughts on different designs that could be implemented to address the issues. Considering their inputs and our research, we then plan to build a privacy setting interface for a social robot, deploy it and study and gain insights/interesting patterns from long-term usage patterns.
