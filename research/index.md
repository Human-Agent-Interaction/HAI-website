In an increasingly interconnected and digital world, the study of human and agent interaction has become a focal point of research, with profound implications for fields such as artificial intelligence, human-computer interaction, psychology, and sociology. This multidisciplinary area of inquiry explores the ways in which humans engage with and respond to intelligent agents, be they in the form of virtual assistants, chatbots, robots, or other AI-driven systems. Understanding the dynamics of this interaction is not only essential for improving the design and effectiveness of these technologies but also for unraveling the complex web of human-technology relationships that shape our daily lives. Our mission is to delve into the intricacies of communication, trust, empathy, and decision-making in the context of human-agent interaction, shedding light on the profound ways in which it is reshaping the fabric of our society.
