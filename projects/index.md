# Current Projects

HAI lab projects focus on exploring and enhancing the collaboration and communication between humans and intelligent software agents, often in the context of technology-driven applications or systems. The primary goal of such projects is to create seamless, efficient, and user-friendly interactions between people and digital agents, such as chatbots, virtual assistants, or autonomous systems. This typically involves the design and implementation of user interfaces, natural language processing, machine learning, and other AI technologies to enable more intuitive and productive exchanges. These projects can have applications in various domains, including customer support, healthcare, education, and more, and seek to improve user experiences, streamline tasks, and make human-agent interactions as natural and effective as possible.
